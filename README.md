# loops-web

A FOSS Loops frontend for the web.

**Note:** Dansup, creator of Loops, banned my account in response to a dispute we had, and has in general been terrible to work with. Due to this, I am not working on this project any more, and *can not* work on this project (I'm not allowed on the platform!)
You can read [this open letter](https://dansup-open-letter.github.io) and [the recounting of events](https://dansup-open-letter.github.io/appendix/) written by others for an understanding of the events that lead to this. Sorry!
If someone else wants to take up the project, reach out :)

# Installation

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run build
cp .env.example .env
```

If you prefer to use standard `npm`, or to use `bun`, you can swap the pnpm commands.

## Usage

Edit your `.env` file as necessary. Then, you can simply start the client like this:

```sh
pnpm run start
```
